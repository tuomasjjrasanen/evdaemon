 evdaemon - Monitor Linux event devices and modify their behavior.
===================================================================

.. contents::

Description
===========

This program was written to mimic the functionality of
`syndaemon <http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/syndaemon1.html>`_ in laptops
with touchpad not recognized as a real touchpad. In addition, unlike syndaemon,
evdaemon does not filter out pointer motion by default and does not limit
it's filtering capabilities to just pointer motion. Furthermore, evdaemon does
not depend on `X Window System <http://www.x.org/wiki/>`_.

Installing
==========

Ubuntu
------

The recommended way to install evdaemon is to
`add it's PPA to your system <https://launchpad.net/~tuos/+archive/codegrove>`_.
This allows you to treat evdaemon as any other Ubuntu package.

Other systems
-------------

The install-procedure adheres the "standard"::

  ./configure
  make && make install

Configuration
=============

.. note:: If you are using evdaemon in a system with Upstart
          (Ubuntu since 6.10 version, Fedora since 9), evdaemon should not
          be started
          manually from command line but started automaticall by Upstart.
          Therefore all the configurations explained in the rest of this
          section should be defined in ``/etc/init/evdaemon.conf`` instead.
          The source distribution contains a template configuration file
          ``etc/init/evdaemon.conf``.
          Other systems might also use old-style init.d script.

Start a daemon process to filter out key or button events reported in
``/dev/input/eventY`` event device for 1.5 seconds after the last key or
button event is reported in ``/dev/input/eventX`` event device::

  evdaemon -i1.5 /dev/input/eventX /dev/input/eventY

**X** and **Y** are event device numbers of wanted devices.
See HANDLERS-properties
of devices in /proc/bus/input/devices for correct values::

  I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=ab41
  N: Name="AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
  P: Phys=isa0060/serio0/input0
  S: Sysfs=/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input3
  U: Uniq=
  H: Handlers=kbd event3 
  B: EV=120013
  B: KEY=4 2000000 3803078 f800d001 feffffdf ffefffff ffffffff fffffffe
  B: MSC=10
  B: LED=7

  I: Bus=0003 Vendor=0f62 Product=1001 Version=0110
  N: Name="Acrox USB & PS/2 Mouse"
  P: Phys=usb-0000:00:02.0-1/input0
  S: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/usb2/2-1/2-1:1.0/input/input8
  U: Uniq=
  H: Handlers=mouse3 event6
  B: EV=17
  B: KEY=1f0000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  B: REL=103
  B: MSC=10

In the example above, ``/dev/input/event6`` would be the correct event device
for the Acrox USB -mouse and ``/dev/input/event3`` for the keyboard.
