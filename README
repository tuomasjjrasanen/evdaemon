Evdaemon
========

Evdaemon syndaemon on steroids. It is to Linux generic event devices
what syndaemon is for just keyboards and touchpads. It allows to
monitor any event device and change other event device's behavior
accordingly.

Evdaemon was originally written to mimic the functionality of
syndaemon in laptops having touchpads not recognized as Synaptics
touchpads. Evdaemon does not limit it's filtering capabilities to just
pointer motion or keyboard events. All filtered and monitored events
can be defined individually.
