Description
===========

This program was written to mimic the functionality of
`syndaemon <http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/syndaemon1.html>`_ in laptops
with touchpad not recognized as a real touchpad.

General information
===================

- **Author**: `Tuomas Räsänen <http://tuos.codegrove.org/>`_ <tuos@codegrove.org>
- **Homepage**: http://codegrove.org/mouseblockerd/

- **Version**: 0.1

Requirements
============

- Linux kernel 2.6.x
- uinput module installed::

    sudo modprobe -i uinput

Recommendations
===============

- Add uinput to the modules automatically loaded on boot if it's not already
  there::

    sudo sh -c "echo uinput >> /etc/modules"

Example usage
=============

Output help information::

  mouseblockerd --help

Start a daemon process to block mouse button events reported in
event5 event device for 1.5 seconds after the last key event is reported
in event3 event device::
