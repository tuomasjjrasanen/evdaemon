Description
===========

This program was written to mimic the functionality of
`syndaemon <http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/syndaemon1.html>`_ in laptops
with touchpad not recognized as a real touchpad. In addition, unlike syndaemon,
evdaemon does not filter out pointer motion by default and does not limit
it's filtering capabilities to just pointer motion. Furthermore, evdaemon does
not depend on `X Window System <http://www.x.org/wiki/>`_.

Requirements
============

- Linux kernel 2.6.x

- Add uinput to the modules automatically loaded on boot if it's not already
  there::

Example usage
=============

Output help information::

  evdaemon --help

Start a daemon process to filter out key or button events reported in
event5 event device for 1.5 seconds after the last key or button event is
reported in event3 event device::

  evdaemon -i1.5 /dev/input/event3 /dev/input/event5

Event devices event3 and event5 used in the example above are probably not
correct in *your* system. See HANDLERS-properties of devices in
/proc/bus/input/devices for correct values.
