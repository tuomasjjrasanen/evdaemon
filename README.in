Description
===========

This program was written to mimic the functionality of
`syndaemon <http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/syndaemon1.html>`_ in laptops
with touchpad not recognized as a real touchpad. In addition, unlike syndaemon,
@PACKAGE_NAME@ does not filter out pointer motion by default and does not limit
it's filtering capabilities to just pointer motion. Furthermore, @PACKAGE_NAME@ does
not depend on `X Window System <http://www.x.org/wiki/>`_.

General information
===================

- **Author**: `Tuomas Räsänen <http://tuos.codegrove.org/>`_ <tuos@codegrove.org>
- **Homepage**: @PACKAGE_URL@
- **License**: GPLv3+ (see COPYING for details)
- **Version**: @VERSION@

Requirements
============

- Linux kernel 2.6.x
- uinput module installed::

    sudo modprobe -i uinput

Recommendations
===============

- Add uinput to the modules automatically loaded on boot if it's not already
  there::

    echo uinput >> /etc/modules

Downloading
===========

- Tarball is available at: @PACKAGE_URL@@VERSION@/@PACKAGE_NAME@-@VERSION@.tar.gz
- Latest sources from public git-repository: http://github.com/tuos/@PACKAGE_NAME@/ ::

    git clone git://github.com/tuos/@PACKAGE_NAME@.git

Installing
==========

The install-procedure adheres the "standard"::

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc
  make && sudo make install

This installs all files with "safe" ``/usr/local`` prefix, but yet installs
the default configuration file in the right place. Afterwards, you
should make sure that proper arguments are given in /etc/evdaemon.conf.

Starting with Upstart
=====================

By default, evdaemon is configured to be started on runlevels 2-5 and stopped
when leaving them. See ``etc/init/evdaemon.conf`` for details.

To start and stop evdaemon explicitely with Upstart, simply type::

  start evdaemon

or::

  stop evdaemon

See ``init(5)`` for details.

To get started
==============

Start a daemon process to filter out key or button events reported in
eventY event device for 1.5 seconds after the last key or button event is
reported in eventX event device::

  @PACKAGE_NAME@ -i1.5 /dev/input/eventX /dev/input/eventY

.. note:: Note that in normal setup, this command is not given explicitely in command
          line, but defined in ``/etc/init/evdaemon.conf`` to be started by Upstart.

X and Y are event device numbers of wanted devices. See HANDLERS-properties
of devices in /proc/bus/input/devices for correct values::

  I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=ab41
  N: Name="AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
  P: Phys=isa0060/serio0/input0
  S: Sysfs=/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input3
  U: Uniq=
  H: Handlers=kbd event3 
  B: EV=120013
  B: KEY=4 2000000 3803078 f800d001 feffffdf ffefffff ffffffff fffffffe
  B: MSC=10
  B: LED=7

  I: Bus=0003 Vendor=0f62 Product=1001 Version=0110
  N: Name="Acrox USB & PS/2 Mouse"
  P: Phys=usb-0000:00:02.0-1/input0
  S: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/usb2/2-1/2-1:1.0/input/input8
  U: Uniq=
  H: Handlers=mouse3 event6
  B: EV=17
  B: KEY=1f0000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  B: REL=103
  B: MSC=10

In the example above, ``/dev/input/event6`` would be the correct event device
for the Acrox USB -mouse and ``/dev/input/event3`` for the keyboard.
