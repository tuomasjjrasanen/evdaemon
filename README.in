 evdaemon - Monitor Linux event devices and modify their behavior
==================================================================

.. contents::

Description
===========

The Code Grove evdaemon program is `syndaemon
<http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/syndaemon1.html>`_ on steroids. It
is to Linux generic event devices what syndaemon is for just keyboards
and touchpads.  It allows to monitor any event device and change other
event device's behavior accordingly.

The evdaemon program was originally written to mimic the functionality
syndaemon in laptops having touchpads not recognized as Synaptics
touchpads.  In addition, unlike syndaemon, evdaemon does not limit
it's filtering capabilities to just pointer motion or keyboard
events. All filtered and monitored events can be defined
individually. And because event devices are not `X Window System
<http://www.x.org/wiki/>`_ specific things, why should the controlling
daemon depend on X?
