Description
===========

This program was written to mimic the functionality of
`syndaemon <http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/syndaemon1.html>`_ in laptops
with touchpad not recognized as a real touchpad. In addition, unlike syndaemon,
@PACKAGE_NAME@ does not filter out pointer motion by default and does not limit
it's filtering capabilities to just pointer motion. Furthermore, @PACKAGE_NAME@ does
not depend on `X Window System <http://www.x.org/wiki/>`_.

Installing
==========

The install-procedure adheres the "standard"::

  ./configure
  make && sudo make install

To get started
==============

Start a daemon process to filter out key or button events reported in
``/dev/input/eventY`` event device for 1.5 seconds after the last key or
button event is reported in ``/dev/input/eventX`` event device::

  @PACKAGE_NAME@ -i1.5 /dev/input/eventX /dev/input/eventY

X and Y are event device numbers of wanted devices. See HANDLERS-properties
of devices in /proc/bus/input/devices for correct values::

  I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=ab41
  N: Name="AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
  P: Phys=isa0060/serio0/input0
  S: Sysfs=/devices/platform/i8042/serio0/input/input3
  U: Uniq=
  H: Handlers=kbd event3 
  B: EV=120013
  B: KEY=4 2000000 3803078 f800d001 feffffdf ffefffff ffffffff fffffffe
  B: MSC=10
  B: LED=7

  I: Bus=0003 Vendor=0f62 Product=1001 Version=0110
  N: Name="Acrox USB & PS/2 Mouse"
  P: Phys=usb-0000:00:02.0-1/input0
  S: Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02.0/usb2/2-1/2-1:1.0/input/input8
  U: Uniq=
  H: Handlers=mouse3 event6
  B: EV=17
  B: KEY=1f0000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  B: REL=103
  B: MSC=10

In the example above, ``/dev/input/event6`` would be the correct event device
for the Acrox USB -mouse and ``/dev/input/event3`` for the keyboard.
