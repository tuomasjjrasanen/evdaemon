Description: Monitor Linux event devices and modify their behavior.
 The Code Grove evdaemon program is syndaemon on steroids. It is to Linux
 generic event devices what syndaemon is for just keyboards and touchpads.
 It allows to monitor any event device and change other event device's
 behavior accordingly.
 .
 The evdaemon program was originally written to mimic the
 functionality syndaemon in laptops having touchpads not recognized as
 Synaptics touchpads. In addition, unlike syndaemon, evdaemon does not
 limit it's filtering capabilities to just pointer motion or keyboard
 events. All filtered and monitored events can be defined
 individually. And because event devices are not X Window System
 specific things, why should the controlling daemon depend on X?
